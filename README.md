**What Is a CAR SERVICE Web Application?**<br>
----


> **CAR SERVICE** is a web application that enables the owners of car services to manage their day-to-day job.
The app has a list with cars (manufacturer, model, year) and price list for available services (oil change, filters change etc.). 
Customers in the app has data list with their contact information (name, telephone, email etc.). Every car arrived at the workshop 
has some identification details (registration plate number, VIN etc.) entered in the app system. As a good service provider, 
the car service keeps history of all services done on customer’s car(s).
Two main roles are implemented in the app: *CUSTOMERS* and *ADMINISTRATORS*.
For all customers, а profile can be generated providing them with access to their personal information via the web UI.
Profile is generated by the administrator using the system and the login information is sent to customer’s email.

**Functionalities**<br>
----
**1.  Public Part**<br>
The public part of the application includes free access to the index page, the login form and the forgotten user password form.

**2.  Customer Part**<br>
The web application provides users with UI to view their personal information and history of all car services.
To be able to access its information each customer must first authenticate.
Customers can change their profile information, login password and download invoice(s) in pdf format for the auto-services performed on their car(s).

**3.  Administrator Part**<br>
System administrators have administrative access to the system and permissions to administer all major information objects in the system,
e.g. to create/edit/delete customers, cars, services, add new customer visit etc.
Administrator can generate profile in the system for each customer. Generate pdf with performed services and reset customers passwords.

**Database**<br>
----

The application maintains a MySQL (MariaDB) database of **```155 car makers```**, **```1008 car models```**, information for **```21 762 cars manufacture years```**
and catalog of **```38 car services```**.

**Rest API**<br>
----
Find some of the REST methods documented [**HERE**](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/4744468/S1LsZB2H).

**Development**<br>
----

1. The backend logic of the app is developed as a REST API.

The following libraries are additionally used to cover project requirements:

*  ```Passay``` - used for random password generation and validation.
*  ```JavaMail``` - used to send emails.
*  ```iText PDF``` - used to generate pdf files.
*  ```DataTables``` - plug-in for the jQuery JavaScript library. Used for all implemented tables in the app.

2. For serving the UI, the team had used Thymeleaf, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQery.

3. Mockito framework is used to test the app -> Total **67 [**TESTS**](/pic's/doc/tests.png)** (***92%** code coverage for business layer*)

**Usage**<br>
----

* Start MySQL server to listen;
* Create data base with name "*car_service_database*";<br>
 **Note:** *You have to use SQL scripts in **[car_service_database](/car_service_database)** folder to create all tables and predefined users with admin role*
* Clone and open project to take the dependencies;<br>
 **Note:** *If a problem occurs, we recommend refreshing the Gradle dependencies*:<br>
`gradlew build --refresh-dependencies`
* For the proper functioning of the application it is necessary:
  - The properties "app.email.user" and "app.email.password" in the file application.properties to be set;
  - Access to "More insecure applications" must be allowed from the email account settings in Gmail;
* Go to **localhost:8080/car-service/index** in your web browser to open the application;
